# Week 7 Problem 2

Make a copy of your code in Problem 1 here and remove the entire plotting section, replacing it with the animation code provided here. 

Complete the animation section to display an animation of the system. An example output is given in "example-animation.gif". 

You don't need to generate the gif - just make sure your code generates the animation in your popup window.
